# Smart Band System – Intelligent Multi-Activity Fitness Tracker

The Smart Band System is a feature-rich, embedded wearable platform designed for professional-grade health monitoring, physical activity tracking, and biometric analysis. Developed for a corporate client specializing in human-performance and fitness technologies, the system combines a suite of environmental and physiological sensors, motion detection modules, and low-power microcontrollers to deliver accurate and extensible monitoring of multiple physical activities in real time.

The system is engineered with an emphasis on modularity, accuracy, and wireless communication, targeting applications in health-tech product development, sports analytics, physiotherapy, and next-generation wearable R&D.

## Project Overview

The goal of the Smart Band System is to create a wearable device capable of capturing complex user movements, vital signs, and environmental data, processing this information locally on a microcontroller, and transmitting actionable insights to a host system (e.g., mobile app, PC interface) using Bluetooth.

The firmware adopts a modular architecture, with each core activity encapsulated in an independent source file. This makes it easy to adapt the system for custom movement detection, additional sensor integration, or alternative hardware platforms. Designed for robust performance in both lab and field environments, the system supports a variety of activities ranging from dynamic workouts to fine-motor pose tracking.

## Software Stack and Dependencies

- **Arduino IDE** with ESP32 Board Support
- **Libraries Used**
  - `BluetoothSerial.h` (for ESP32)
  - `Adafruit_BMP085` or `Adafruit_Sensor` (I2C pressure sensor)

## Firmware Architecture

The firmware is cleanly organized into separate `.ino` files, each representing a discrete activity module or utility. This structure allows firmware engineers to quickly isolate and develop new behaviors or test sensor routines independently.

### Core Runtime: `Smart_band.ino`

- Initializes all global resources (Bluetooth, serial monitor, sensor pins)
- Accepts mode-selection commands from Bluetooth
- Routes control to the correct activity module
- Implements idle, sleep, or default states when not active

### Activity Modules

- `Pulse_Counter.ino`: Heartbeat detection with analog signal filtering
- `Climbing.ino`: Detects elevation change using pressure variation
- `Jumping.ino`: Spike-detection from vertical accelerometer readings
- `ROWING.ino`: Uses interval-based logic for rhythmic stroke detection
- `Swimming.ino`: Repetition tracking with adjustable movement tolerances
- `Weight_Lifting.ino`: Counts complete range-of-motion cycles
- `Yoga.ino`: Detects holds and slow transitions with timeout-based posture recognition

Each module includes fine-tuned thresholding, configurable timing, and interrupt-free logic optimized for portable microcontrollers.

## Data Flow and Bluetooth Communication

The system communicates wirelessly over Bluetooth, allowing for:

1. **Mode Selection** – Users select an activity mode from a connected app or terminal.
2. **Real-time Monitoring** – Detected motion events or biometric signals are processed and formatted.
3. **Data Transmission** – Results (e.g., repetition count, pulse rate) are sent back to the host device.
4. **Activity Switching** – New modes can be entered via remote command without rebooting the system.

All data transmission is formatted for easy integration into mobile apps, desktop dashboards, or cloud logging platforms.
